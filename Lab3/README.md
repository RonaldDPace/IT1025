Vector Graphics uses complexed geometry and does not lose quality when enlarged or reduced.



##### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

Lossless Compession preserves all image data great quality more memory space.
Lossy Compression uses less image data resulting in a lessor quality image,and artifracting in high color contrast. 



##### File Formats

GIF:JPEG:PNG:

Similarities:  They are the most commonly found in web design.
Differences :  GIF ideal for animation,line drawing,and simple graphics. JPEG great for saving memory space using smaller file sizes for                movies and games, though it causes refracting. PNG great for photos with high contrast,transparency especially alpha                      channel transparency.
