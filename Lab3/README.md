### Executive Summary 

### Python IDLE

The differences between these editors :
Shell: It runs one instruction at a time.
 File: It runs the typed complete program.
 
 

##### Code Examples

A Variable is memory location to store a value.... (example) myName, myAge .
An Assignment Statement is done with a single equals sign...(example)  myName = input().
A function is a def statement...(example) def Function-(Parameter list)
Three data types : int , float , string .


### Graphics


##### Raster vs. Vector Graphics

Raster Graphics uses pixels and when the image is enlarged  it loses quality.
Vector Graphics uses complexed geometry and does not lose quality when enlarged or reduced.



##### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

Lossless Compession preserves all image data great quality more memory space.
Lossy Compression uses less image data resulting in a lessor quality image,and artifracting in high color contrast. 



##### File Formats

GIF:JPEG:PNG:

Similarities:  They are the most commonly found in web design.
Differences :  GIF ideal for animation,line drawing,and simple graphics. JPEG great for saving memory space using smaller file                sizes for movies and games, though it causes refracting. PNG great for photos with high contrast,transparency                  especially alpha channel transparency.


##### File Properties

My logo image has 4 layers.
Properties of it's file are : Size 7.67Kb, Size on disk 32Kb, and it opens in chrome.
        

### Lucidchart

### Summary


My Lucidchart experience introduced the basic process to Programming Methodologies, that is, the process of Analyzing complexed real-life problems, Planning for software development, and Controlling that process. Using Descission Flow Charts to simplify the process.

### Introduction to Networking

##### Data Transmission

The relationship of these terms takes this process ; first protocol for packets to sent to an IP address through a router or switching unit which is addressed to the proper DNS.



##### Networking Hardware


Benefit of a switch over a hub a is ; a hub can't detect, specific devices,direct data to the correct MAC address, keep record of MAC addresses of the devices it directs data to.

Benefit of a router over hubs and switches is ; a router can route data from network to netwwork by IP addresses.


##### Network Topologies


Single point of failure happens when a part of the system stops working causing the entire system to fail, such as, a router in your smart-home,  a software application for a business practice.

Infrastrucure Topology compared to a Wireless Mesh:
A basic infrastructural network is hard-wired system which can get expensive with need of multible access points but reliable with-in reason. A wireless Mesh network would be cost feasible in reference installation cost,construction down time (inconvinces).
In my opinion as to which is better it really depends on the size , the number of access points needed, and the locations or distance of those points.



##### Network Design

##### NSA/CSS


The NSA's role in U.S. cybersecurity save lives by defending vital networks globally, advancing U.S. goals and alliances, protecting U.S. citizens privacy rights, and overcome real threats to our country discovering adversarie's secrets,protecting U.S. secrets, and outmaneuvering our adversaries in cyberspace.
