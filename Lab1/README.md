### Executive Summary - this is an example... be sure to compose your own original summary
The purpose of Lab 1 is to create a GitHub account to house artifacts for IT1025 and examine types and compnents of an Information System.

### Information System Components
daily uses are; cell phones,internet ,home security systems,wireless devices.
consists of the following;hardware(harddrives,displayskeyboards),software(word,cubase,logicpro),database(structured data held in a computer) ,network(computing devices that exchange data using connections using nodes),and people(programers,analysts,help desk).Together they input,process,output,feedback,and control data and/or information.


### GitHub
##### Client - Server Architecture ;aspects accomplished are the client of a website refers to the web browser and the website is the server or host.What this means to the client side is servers,storage,maintenance,and programing is done on the server's side.
##### Cloud Computing;dropbox,onenote,are two other forms of cloud computing.

### Hardware
##### Hard Drives and Memory
##### ALU and the Control Unit
##### CUP, Input & Output
##### Logic Gates and Circuits
##### IEEE

### Conclusion
Lab 1 gets you acclimated to the components of Information Systems,and resoures that are relevent to programming,analizing,storing,retrieving,and inputing data.
