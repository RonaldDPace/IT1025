### Executive Summary 



### Cybersecurity and Encryption

##### Information Systems Security

      Each component of The Security Triad that would impact my job at Amazon :
      
      Confidentiality; Only share information about your duties and resources about my job with authoriized personnel.
      
      Integrity; Assure information needed to perform job duties can be trusted consistantly 
                      with out malicious intentional nor unintentional misrepresntation.
                      
      Availability; I would need to provide access to my work files for constituents.
      
      
        
      Three daily tasks that are required to authenticate :
      
      To identify the authorized by; (1) something they know.  (2) by something they have. (3) something they are.
      
      Each can be converted to multifactor authentication by combining two or more of the three requirements to to                 authenticate.
      
      
      ACL is a user list that ensures access to only appropriate information and or resoures. ACCESS CONTROL LIST.
      The advantage of an acl is each user only has access to specific capabilites such as read, delete ,or add data.
      
      RBAC is a role based access control . The advantage to rbac is it can be easily modified when changing the duties that       are assigned, making managing less complexed over an ACL.
      
      
      The interaction of ciphertext: a sender uses a public key to encrypt and send plaintext which becomes ciphertext, then       recipient then use a private to to decode it.
      
      
      A public key is needed to begin the encryption with the private key.
                                            
      
     
##### Cryptography

      
      Encryption is achieved by a three position shift of letters.( Caesar Cipher Exploration ) 
      
      The result in using the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" it showed how many times  each letter been used in my             sentences. Where other langages are concerned yes the out-come would differ because of the spellings of words.
      
      A "Polyalphabetic cipher" is a cipher that uses multiple subsitution alphabets.
      
      Polyalphabetical Exploration was a multi-shift fingerprint that's difficult to decipher.


##### Brute-Force

      "Brute-Force" cryptanalytic technique is trying ever possible decryption key for a cipher.
       How this relates to Kerckhoffs"s principle is part of the cipher remains secret even when it's known
       how the cipher works.
