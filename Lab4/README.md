### Executive Summary 



### Cybersecurity and Encryption

##### Information Systems Security


      Each component of The Security Triad that would impact my job at Amazon :
      
      Confidentiality; Only share information about your duties and resources about my job with authoriized personnel.
      
      Integrity; Assure information needed to perform job duties can be trusted consistantly 
                      with out malicious intentional nor unintentional misrepresntation.
                      
      Availability; I would need to provide access to my work files for constituents.
      
      
        
      Three daily tasks that are required to authenticate :To identify the authorized accessor by; 
      
      (1) something they know. (2) by something they have. (3) something they are.
      
      Each can be converted to multifactor authentication by combining two or more of the three requirements to to                             authenticate.
      
      
      ACL is a user list that ensures access to only appropriate information and or resoures. ACCESS CONTROL LIST.
      The advantage of an acl is each user only has access to specific capabilites such as read, delete ,or add data.
      
      RBAC is a role based access control . The advantage to rbac is it can be easily modified when changing the duties that 
      are assigned, making managing less complexed over an ACL.
      
      
      The interaction of ciphertext: a sender uses a public key to encrypt and send plaintext which becomes ciphertext, then                   recipient then use a private to to decode it.
      
      
      A public key is needed to begin the encryption with the private key.
                                            
      
     
##### Cryptography

      
      Encryption is achieved by a three position shift of letters.( Caesar Cipher Exploration ) 
      
      The result in using the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" it showed how many times  each letter been used in my                       sentences. Where other langages are concerned yes the out-come would differ because of the spellings of words.
      
      A "Polyalphabetic cipher" is a cipher that uses multiple subsitution alphabets.
      
      Polyalphabetical Exploration was a multi-shift fingerprint that's difficult to decipher.
      


##### Brute-Force


      "Brute-Force" cryptanalytic technique is trying ever possible decryption key for a cipher.
       How this relates to Kerckhoffs"s principle is part of the cipher remains secret even when it's known
       how the cipher works.
       
       

### Internet Architecture


##### Internet Protocol


      An IP address is the numbers assigned to computer, interface, device, or network that allows communication between           them.
      The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is, IPv6 is the next generation after IPv4, and it's massively bigger than IPv4.
      
      ICANN is a nonprofit public benefit corporation that helps ensure a stable and unified global internet by cordinating       unique       identifing naming system around the globe.
      


##### TCP/IP


      The resonsibility of TCP/IP is basically to define the details of how data is sent and recieved through network                         adapters, hubs, switches, routers, and other network communication hardware.
      
      The Client-Server model applies to TCP/IP by the client/computer/device dails the server's phone  it lisens for it's IP         
      address and port numbers inorder to send and recieve data.The connection will remain open until the client or server disconnects.
      
      Layers are important to changing techology because, any layer can be changed without affecting other layers.
      
      The types of applications that can run on "The Application Layer" are SMTP, FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMHP4, and SNMP.
      
      
      
##### Internet Security


      HTTP is a clear text that"s widely used for viewing web pages that supports the client-server model data vulnerable to hackers.
       
      Protocols used to make HTTP secure are,  HTTPS takes plain text data and makes it impossible to read through encryption. SSL uses 
      a digital certificate to authenticate with a public key. TLS is the latest encryption protocol.
       


##### Securing your Web Browser


      One should always secure their browser to protect critical data.
      
      One risk described in the article is without encryption all data can be read, used, or altered by hackers.
      
      
      
### Internet Programming


##### World Wide Web Consortium 


      Tim Berners-Lee is the inventer of "The World Wide Web" ,and founder of (W3C). He created the (W3C) to lead the world wide web to       it's full potencial by developing protocols and guidelines that involves participation, sharing knowledge, thereby building trust       on a global scale.
    
      A standard of "Cooperation" is most important , because none of the other standards would even be possible such as                       "Adherence to Principles", "Collective Empowerment", "Availaility", and "Voluntary Adaption".
    


##### HTML5 and CSS


      The purpose of HTML in creating my web page is to edit my text using notepad with document type declaration then                         adding alined web page. The purpose of CSS is to add presentation definition.
      
      
      
##### HTML and XML


      XML differs to HTML by tags are not predifined, it's designed to carry data-with a focus on what the data is.
      HMTL was designed to display data with afocus on how the data looks.
      
      
      
##### Components of a URL


       Http/s; is the scheme. (tells the type of address) . WWW.Wikipedia.org; is the domain. (shows the company that runs the site) .          Wikipedia.org is the the top level domain. (it ends with .com , .org ,and more...).  /w/index.php; is the default page/filepath          (it directs the browser to a specific page within the site). ?title=burrito; is the parameter. (starts with a question mark and          provides information for the browser to load the correct the correct page).  #breakfastburrito; is the anchor. (it starts with an        hashtag and direct the browser to a specific part of a long page).  
       
##### File Compression


       The purpose and use of zipping/compressing files/folders is to group or archive multiple files/folers into one ,saving time and          resources.
       
       The difference between the compressed files/folders, is it has one folder of 217kb. The uncompressed files/folders has three            files and one folder that uses 288kb.
